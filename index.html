            <p>Surely you have ever heard of the opportunities offered by RFID technology for your event, for example, for access to the venue. But you can go much further, squeezing the potential of this technology to even make payments at the event. No cash, no worries. All with a simple movement of the wrist, all applying RFID in the form of a bracelet normally.

                This is what we know as cashless payment, or payment by bracelet, one of the great innovations in festivals. It is not by chance, nor a whim, that from the largest to the smallest festivals they are beginning to incorporate it, since it brings great benefits in all areas.
                
                It should be noted that, despite the fact that the use of cashless payment has become very popular in large events such as festivals, the reality is much broader and can be applied to any type of event, from food fairs to sporting events, including, even corporate events.
                </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>WHY USE CASHLESS PAYMENT AT YOUR EVENT? </li>
                <p>Payment by wristband allows a considerable reduction in queues and waiting times. It eliminates processes such as withdrawing money, paying, waiting for the change... Since it is charged as soon as the bracelet is read or, what is the same, less than 1 second. It greatly improves the user experience!</p>
                <li>ELIMINATION OF HUMAN FAULT AND FRAUD</li>
                <p>Another reason for the use of cashless payment in events is the reduction of human error. As everything is digitized, the bar staff does not have to handle cash and, therefore, there is no room for error. In addition, the system has an integrated anti-theft system, with nominative balance, which prevents someone else from using the balance in the event of theft or loss.</p>
                <li>INCREASE IN CONSUMPTION</li>
                <p>According to our recent study on habits and consumption at festivals, using the cashless payment system increases consumption by almost 20% compared to conventional payment methods at events. This growth occurs thanks to the so-called "impulse purchase" and the ease and convenience of the cashless payment system to favor it.</p>
                <li>TOTAL CONTROL OF STOCK AND SALES</li>
                <p>Cashless payment has one of its strengths in the generation of information in real time and the total control that this entails. You will be able to know at all times how sales are going, even segmented by bars or, going further, by each of the waiters. The same for the stock, with an exhaustive control of it. All of this makes it possible to better optimize resources and anticipate unforeseen events that may occur, in addition to the enormous value of the information that is generated for subsequent analysis.</p>
